[![Full discovery retrospective board](uploads/retro/retro-disco.png)](uploads/retro/retro-disco.png)

## Actions

- Checking slides one more time before the presentation  🤦

- Jonno: Set aside some time once a week to reflect on and write up notes throughout project.

- Being more deliberate about the final synthesis weeks, making sure we are all agreed on what sessions are needed in advance / what we can accommodate around other deliverables

- Stephen: Thinking about the wiki pages earlier in the process. 🙄
- Stephen: Scheduling known service stakeholders sooner (but still talking to them after the main user research).

- [ ] Find out how to better lean on miro / other features it has from the other NB design teams



## Kudos

* All of the attendees on the final S&T - great turnout
- The team for their sensitive handling of the egos involved
* Jag for MCing the final S&T and fielding the tough crowd
* All team for bringing everything together over the course of the project! It feels like a real positive end to everything!!
* The team for pulling together and working hard to make it happen despite a bunch of pressures.
* Everyone for holding it together at the right time!
* Stephen for wielding an ungodly amount of data and weaving it into an impressive suite of service level assets
* Blueprint review helped set the scene for the final S&T and helped engage the Inspection Teams - Stephen & Jonno
* Mark and Shaun for all the organising and keeping us grounded.

## Went well

- Today! Final Show & Tell and the Service Assessment were a  much more streamlined approach than previous versions and better for it.
  - show and tell was excellent
  - service assessment was excellent
- Meeting prior to the final Show & Tell to organise. This was really helpful and helped structure what we were talking about.
- Overall structure of the research phase was manageable to cover the scale/breadth and provided focus
  - Splitting out service areas into separate weeks allowed for focus, removed distractions.
  - Dedicated and time-boxed research weeks.
- Synthesis & Assumptions in Mallard - play, stop pause post its worked well
- Leaning on existing frameworks / business models to catalyse analysis and for assumptions testing
- Lots of complex threads pulled together very coherently - strong and clear narrative / recommendations
- Really good outputs given a lot of scope for the time.
- Incremental improvements to weekly show and tell process (prep and during call) - seems much slicker now
- Back catalogue of weekly show and tells were really useful for revisiting in final weeks for wrap up
- Having Amy on the team! Closer ties built with Digital and useful insights into their ways of working
- Having a dedicated room in Mallard which also gives us space outside the room to spread out.
  - M209-shire is clearly now our Disco-ville: great to be able to spread out and keep things up.
- Wiki structuring works well.
- It's been good checking in with everyone individually each week to hear how it's going and help facilitate.
- Making a conscious effort not to get bogged down in the task details and sticking to the service impacts etc.
- Using Google Sheets instead of Miro!

## To improve

- Timing & engagement of key user groups when we're going to need their close cooperation - most were happy to make it happen but we also got push back
- We have a core set of really good activities for an 8 week disco now, just some fine-tuning around sequencing and allowing time to breathe (just not in anyone's face).
- Being able to analyse before creating assets.
- Documenting as we go - room to breathe. I have paid for lack of note clean up time when it got to analysis
- Wiki write up, feels like we never leave enough breathing room for it and it's a tricky task to handle / tool to wield at a point where we are all knackered / need something simpler
- Having the service assessment in the last week means a loss of time for analysis and synthesis, and fleshing out/creaming off recommendations.
- balance of talking v discussion in show and tell
- Consistency of weeknotes
- Clarity of roles and individual areas/outputs. Maybe spend a bit of time up front as a team to get everyone's input and make a collective outline plan so everyone feels involved and comfortable.
