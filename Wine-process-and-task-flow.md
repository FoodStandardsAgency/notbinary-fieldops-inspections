Wine is the exception to the other inspection services in that it uses a single system throughout. The caveat to this is that while there is a single system that allows the full process to be followed users are, for reasons including a lack of trust in the systems, duplicating work throughout - Storing reports in both the MS Access Wine Database and personal and shared drives for example.

The wine database (hereafter refered to as the Wine DB) is on an old technology, Microsoft Access (MS Access). This is incompatible with newer technology such as PowerBI and so there is large disconnect between the data collected and available and decision making that could be done using this data.

## Planning
Assigned visit by FVC. Once completed the designated plants assigned to me I can contact other FVCs to see if they need help. Part-time UAI.

### Duplications of effort in Planning
We observed that duplications are occuring when users are planning when visits will occur. Information is stored in several different places (MS Access Wine Database and downloaded and then edited Excel spreadsheets) that can then fall out of sync with each other due to a lack of version control/single source of truth.

### Duplications of effort in scheduling
Weekly progress is tracked across multiple Excel sheets by different users.
Information about previous visits is stored in various drives and systems. Reinforcing that there is not a single source of truth.

### Duplication of effort in reporting
Users cannot save images in the MS Access Wine DB, and so must use a separate system to do this creating a duplication of effort that could be streamlined if one tool would allow photos and write-up to be done.
Users do not trust MS Access to write things up. As a result they are using Microsoft Word to complete reports and letters and then having to copy and paste these into the MS Access Wine DB. Duplicating storage and effort.

| **Monitoring** | MS Outlook/Wine inbox | Used to Dropdown labelled Production Reports 2020, take them out and put them into this folder. Then transfer manually into the MS Access DB. Then delete from the inbox. | WSB21 is completed by FBOs every year. They send these in sometimes directly to their assigned wine inspector and into the Wine Inbox. |
| **Updating** | FSA Website | Provides information for the public, intended to ease the amount of queries received by inspectors | Used to be a valuable resource for FBOs but has recently been updated and become less usable. This has resulted in further work for inspectors when providing advice. |

### Duplication of effort in operational jobs
Time and expense recording is done in both iHR and the MS Access Wine DB.
