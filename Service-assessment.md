## Assessment Panel

### Outcome

The Team delivered a strong Discovery fully meeting the standard. 

The work the Team has done is rich and insightful and presents the FSA with powerful opportunities for positive service transformation.

If this were a usual discovery, we would indeed recommend the service proceed to Alpha. But in this instance we recommend the service proceeds to more senior consideration of the findings and recommendations.

### Assessment panel recommendations

- Ensure that Discovery recommendations are presented to appropriate senior leadership within the FSA for their due consideration. Given the nature of the principal recommendations, this is necessary to enable any of the recommendations to be taken further.
- To enable the service transformation proposed within the Discovery, a Programme approach will be required encompassing business change, recruitment, and service design and development.
- Introduction of strategic alignment to implement consistency was well-evidenced, however there was uncertainty from one key stakeholder relating to the ‘Head of Inspections’ recommendation. This recommendation may benefit from further articulation to help clarify the need to the prospective senior audience and inform progress.
- Consider the inclusion of Audits within the scope of any future activity, as there are clear synergies that could be exploited.
  - *Note: whilst audit didn’t have the same time on it as other areas, a tooling overview for the audit lifecycle, and summary recommendations for the service were completed.* 
  - *The notes are in the [shared drive](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1upVEeT90ssSTp65uG9BYxhiO7ysMlaHRjNdIIRQc4n8), with [summary sections in the wiki](audit-summary) for easy access.*
  - *The inspection framework outlined (Plan through Followup, plus Operate) is usefully applicable for audit across inspection services, and the recommendations for audit overlap and align with the general backlog.*
- Ensure the customers are duly considered as a part of any future activity. Customer insight, pain points and needs may identify further potential opportunities for service improvements and efficiency. There may also be scope to include other inspection type services with whom these customers interact on a regular basis e.g. Defra Farm inspection services.
- Consider exploring wider inspection models and technology. For example, there are multiple businesses that deploy people around the country and manage time and activity on the fly e.g. British Gas engineers. They have a portfolio of planned visits, but this must flex during the day in response to the realities of the actual specific job found on the site. Their operations and tooling may have many synergies with Inspections.
- Expectation that all will be solved by Technology. There needs to be some expectation management for people and they need to be involved in this. Risk of building, handing over and then a fall back to tried and tested methods.
- Amy-Kate integrated well into the team and found working with the team a great learning exercise. However, the experience has shown that whilst it is possible to work remotely to a co-located team, it is not optimal. This needs consideration in future Discoveries as to how best to integrate FSA staff into a team.
- Note that the team have effectively been working backwards in their sequencing - started off looking at timesheeting and have been working back through various activities since. There are  reasons to look at Approvals next, as this is the first touchpoint for many businesses into the whole remit of Operations activities.
- Review the portfolio of Discoveries completed by Not Binary to draw together an overarching picture of FSA services and business. Identify trends, patterns and opportunities that may emerge from this helicopter view.

### Assessment panel observations

Another excellent piece of Discovery from this team. The work they have done across Operations is insightful and presents the FSA with powerful opportunities for positive service transformation. Even more so, they have built a colourful and rich picture of the existing service which as they build their understanding and join the jigsaw of service pieces presents even more opportunities.

It was clear that the initial scope and timescale for the Discovery was challenging. This has resulted in some compromises, but this does not devalue the quality.

For example, audit was not included in the scope, but the work has shown there is a strong synergy. There were no customer interviews, so whilst the Discovery provides in-depth insight into the FSA operation, the customer interaction with the service will likely require further insight.

The recommendations are clearly focused at the service design. Technology change may help, but the key to service transformation is structural alignment and behavioural change.

The team did a good, thorough job, working with a wide-range of stakeholders on a wide scope of work within the timeframe, and they have captured strong evidence to support their recommendations.

The omission of audits is potentially a missed opportunity as it maps well to the other aspects and may have drawn in additional stakeholders with different requirements – whilst appreciating the time factors, this should be considered for inclusion in any work going forward

Recommendations are at a high-level and this is suggested as a pre-cursor to any changes (e.g. technology changes) local to a particular process. For example, consider whether some inspections should even be within scope, not just of this programme, but even the FSA e.g. wine is very different inspections model.

Things the team did well:

- Clear that a broad range of stakeholders had been engaged and were involved with the work
- Presented and demonstrated alongside some of the key stakeholders
- Clear consideration of the various stakeholders within field ops for a fairly wide scope of work
- Identified a wider issue across the different processes rather than just focussing on issues within each (e.g. technology changes)
- Brought out the local innovation that is present within the field to solve gaps and weaknesses in existing process and systems
- Technology issues and interactions were still captured and documented
- Clear recommendations for both Field Ops (around managing the processes together) and IT / Digital (providing services that work together) required for improvements to be possible

Possible gaps:

- Food Business Operators / external stakeholders (though this was identified by the team)
- Back-office / system administrators were considered but not spoken with directly due to time / prioritisation considerations
- Audits were not included, and relevant stakeholders with aligning processes may have been missed
- There are other aspects to these processes that may need to be included or at least considered before the next of phase of work should begin (e.g. approvals / registrations processes for the business being inspected)

## What was the initial problem you were asked to look into?

### Context

Field Operations Inspections enable the FSA to deliver on its core remit: to ensure that the food people buy and eat is safe and what it says it is. The FSA undertakes inspection activity across meat, dairy and wine food businesses in order to ensure standards are maintained for public health. These official controls are defined in legislation and applied according to operational policy that is informed by industry constraints. 

While the FSA has an ongoing presence in some meat plants, this discovery is focused on unannounced inspections in meat establishments, as well as dairy and wine inspections. 

### Size of problem

Each inspection domain services a population of food businesses with a combination of dedicated and supporting inspectors, details of which can be found in the [service context](https://github.com/notbinary/fsa-fieldops-inspections/wiki/service-context) and [volumes](https://github.com/notbinary/fsa-fieldops-inspections/wiki/volumes-and-metrics) writeup:  

*   Dairy: 8500 farms inspected on a 3 month to 10 year cycle by 9+25 inspectors
*   Meat: 1200 cutting plants inspected by 3+24 inspectors (plus 9 field veterinary leads and 18 field veterinary coordinators)
*   Wine: 700 vineyards + 1,330 traders inspected on a 6 month to 4 year cycle by 6+5 inspectors

Charges made for inspection work in scope are not reflective of the cost of delivering inspections (in part because some activities are not chargeable, and in part because the rates are historically set and not current). They amount to less than 1% of charges recoverable for ongoing inspection. It is not currently possible to reliably determine the cost of delivery. 

### Discovery question/hypothesis

The discovery remit is to identify common patterns across inspection domains. The goal is to identify opportunities to simplify, standardise and share practice and tooling, as well as to streamline what may be disjointed to make it work better. 

### Team observations

#### Was the initial question/hypothesis correct?

Inspection is driven by a public health mandate in each domain, which includes traceability checks. Wine is also governed by market protection legislation. 

The inspection lifecycle is broadly consistent across inspection domains. There are specific differences in each food area, but the same general process from planning through carrying out an inspection and reporting outcomes is common. 

There are common needs for resourcing and managing inspection assets and artefacts, which are not consistently met by the operational and technology structures in place. 

#### Possible gaps/alternatives

The discovery has only examined the non-ongoing inspection lifecycles that the FSA has explicit remit over, although there will be public health inspection considerations across the end-to-end food lifecycle (farm-to-fork), some of which are handled by other agencies. 

The Approvals process is a consistent entry point for establishing an inspection schedule for an establishment across food domains, but this has been out of scope for this discovery. 

The complexity of visit cycles and the impact on resource scheduling invites further analysis for modelling potential which is beyond the scope of this discovery. 

#### Reflections/recommendations

There is a clear opportunity for taking a common service-wide approach to inspections, but this is hampered by organisational silos and a deep reliance on meat hygiene inspectors and the external service delivery partner to supplement inspection capacity. 

Establishing a single owner for inspections across the organisation can help drive consistency of vision and practice. Aligning services while respecting the differences in domains will need careful programme management and focus. Such a role can help navigate and prioritise effort during transformation, as well as maintain service consistency once established as a business-as-usual operation. 


## **Align stakeholders around the definition of the problem and recommendations**

**_Demonstrate the team were able to engage the key stakeholders (internal and external, if appropriate) about the nature of the problem being explored and resulting recommendations at the end of the Discovery._**

**Team score**: Met/Partially met/Did not meet

### Team observations

#### Something the team did well

The team carried out weekly Show and Tells sessions to engage stakeholders around the broad scope of the discovery. These included Field Ops staff directly involved in Inspection activity, as well as other stakeholders ranging from Finance, Application Support and Data, through Operational Assurance and Ops Transformation. We have consulted broadly to understand the strategic and operational context in which inspections are carried out. The service blueprint review in Week 7 was effective in bringing the wide stakeholder community back together to validate and align around our findings. 

#### Possible gaps

The problem definition is internally focused and defined. This provides a fixed perspective at risk of missing opportunities from external partners who are key stakeholders in shaping, delivering and receiving services. It is important to understand their perspectives, expectations and constraints for any future service or product development that changes how inspections are fulfilled and communicated. 

#### Reflections/recommendations

Each inspection domain has its own ongoing programme of change and continuous improvement. While these are necessarily unique to deal with the challenges of specific domains, there is no strategic alignment to leverage improvements made in one area across other areas. Each domain is trying to solve similar problems in its own way. It is worthwhile taking stock of these individual efforts, identifying common priorities and building the programme in context of the vision operating model and ops transformation priorities. 


## Identify all of the service users and their experience of the current service (where one exists). 

**_The team should have a good understanding of user needs, understand what users are trying to do when they engage with the current service._**

**Team score**: Met/Partially met/Did not meet

### Team observations

#### Something the team did well

The team has engaged across all parts of Field Ops, including Inspection Leads, full-time and part-time staff, as well as contract vets, to build a rich picture of the needs of users involved in delivering inspections across all domains within scope. We have been able to abstract needs that are common for an inspection service, as well as identify pain points and opportunities specific to individual areas, including those arising from how service practice and workarounds may have organically evolved rather than being designed.   

#### Possible gaps

No food business operators, scheme operators or other government agencies were consulted as part of this discovery. The customer experience is variable depending on the drivers for each inspection domain, which affects how inspection and guidance activity is shaped and undertaken. More needs to be understood here in order to design a service that balances business and customer needs. 

#### Reflections/recommendations

The customer perspective is unknown, and the customer approach is undefined. The FSA should define how it wants to position its relationship with Food Business Operators. This will fundamentally influence how - and how consistently - the inspection service is delivered on the ground, and also inform what tools and metrics are needed to support case management, guidance, helpdesk communication, customer intelligence (such as plant profiles) and other elements that affect service user experience. 


## Identify the key service challenges and opportunities for better meeting user needs

**_For example: what are the principle elements that need solving, what could improve the user experience, efficiencies, customer satisfaction improvements, cost-benefit to change_**

**Team score**: Met/Partially met/Did not meet

### Team observations

#### Something the team did well

The team has built a good understanding of how the different inspection domains have evolved organically and independently since coming under the purview of the FSA, while still being constrained by the original meat plant inspection function. This historical context has helped give a sound appreciation of the challenges of unpicking legacy structures and practice in order to move the inspection service forward coherently. 

For example, an absence of service design coupled with siloed development over the years has led to variable digital maturity in each domain, inconsistently applied guidance and a proliferation of different tools to achieve similar goals. This leaves services delicately balanced and vulnerable to transformation shock. 

#### Possible gaps

Any forward implementation strategy will be constrained by digital maturity within domains and individual digital literacy. User expectations around how technology solutions will address pain points will need to be more carefully understood and managed in order to positively impact adoption success. Non-digital solutions (such as pens over tablets) may be more appropriate in some environmental contexts, especially for user facing situations (rather than backend application services). 

#### Reflections/recommendations

The key service challenge is not going to be solved by new tooling or technology. Each inspection domain operates autonomously. This gives freedom to solve problems and deliver the service, but results in increasingly divergent practice. The current model of shared resourcing (reliant as it is on meat hygiene inspectors) to fulfil core activities frustrates delivery of wine and dairy inspection. Addressing the operational positioning of inspections (by bringing it under a single leadership) and the resourcing conundrum (by protecting inspector time and ensuring balanced team structures) is going to be essential for building a flexible streamlined inspection service.


## Identify key areas of focus for the next phase of work

**_For example: a part of the service that could cause particular pain or be difficult, or needs delving into in more depth to adequately understand. Indeed, whether further work is actually needed._**

**Team score**: Met/Partially met/Did not meet

### Team observations

#### Something the team did well

The team has identified an extensive backlog of potential opportunities and next steps across the broad scope of Field Ops Inspections. We recognise that there is good work that is already occurring in isolated parts of the business. The backlog is presented in such a way as to help the FSA build on existing good practice and make informed decisions about where to start from to tackle the many opportunities and non-trivial challenges around inspections across the organisation.  

#### Possible gaps

No cost-benefit analysis has been carried out as part of this discovery. There is a significant disparity between recoverable costs and actual costs of delivering some of the inspection services. There is a lack of good data to accurately determine the true cost of delivery against which to baseline and make informed cost-based decisions. 

#### Reflections/recommendations

The backlog focuses on process and technology actions that the FSA should consider to improve inspection services. The core recommendations we propose are fundamental and precedent to these. The backlog should be considered in the context of existing work being done in relation to the vision operating model (Ops Transformation) and business concept entity modelling (Data Team). 



## Demonstrate how the team has worked together using agile methods and the learning from this

**_How did you work together, in particular, how you engaged the business and stakeholders. How have you adapted as you learned more._**

**Team score**: Met/Partially met/Did not meet

### Team observations

#### Something the team did well

The team used standups, sprint planning, retrospectives and show and tells to focus each sprint and share insight. We adapted our usual delivery model to reflect the three-strand scope of the discovery, dedicating an investigation week (or ‘spike’) to each inspection domain. This helped keep focus and clarity during a period of intense learning. A test-driven discovery approach was used to expedite research and synthesis, particularly around validating the potential and shape of a reusable inspection lifecycle.  

#### Possible gaps

We were not able to get to as many site visits to do contextual research as would have been desirable. 

#### Reflections/recommendations

The range of scope has been intense to cover within the timeframe available. Based on this and the previous discovery we have a better sense of what our sprint ‘velocity’ is, particularly in relation to research interviews. This will help with planning in future discoveries. 

There is time pressure on planning which can be mitigated by the FSA mobilising key users with clear scope of engagement prior to the discovery window. Involving the discovery team at the appropriate point to inform this is important to ensure a shared understanding of discovery scope and goals. Finding time in between discoveries to accommodate this without compromising time on wrap up will be the challenge.
