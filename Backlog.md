A backlog of options are presented below for each of the key inspection lifecycle stages. They are based on the following actions:

* **Extend:** build on existing good practice and share what works across inspection domains
* **Start:** not necessarily the low hanging fruit, but areas worth addressing first to relieve pain points and leverage opportunities
* **Queue:** consider these next, and be mindful other work done beforehand enables - or at least doesn't inhibit - how these could be implemented 
* **Stop:** consider not doing these things, and achieving the same results using alternative existing options (rather than building something new)

The majority of opportunities revolve around these core principles: 

* **Simplify:** eliminate complication, remove distraction
* **Standardise:** improve consistency, enable re-use
* **Share:** build on good practice, re-use assets and intelligence
* **Streamline:** make it more joined-up and transparent
