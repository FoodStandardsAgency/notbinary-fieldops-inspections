## Understand the service blueprint

Business analysts and service designers take all the things that are needed to make a service work (such as people, processes, technology) and put them in context. The service blueprint is a way of collating and summarising that information in a single page.

This blueprint gives an end-to-end view of everything that should be considered to enable **Field Operations Inspections** to work efficiently and effectively.

The blueprint addresses a service-level view; the user-level experience is addressed elsewhere in [user segments](user-needs#user-segments), [personas](personas), and [user stories](user-stories).

The blueprint for Field Operations Inspections is split into three sections, each with a consistent layout (see [below](#blueprint-images) for visuals):

The **consolidated blueprint** is available in Google Sheets format: [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1OslSNPH1nC7HE3IPYpeHy9ZUc4U4oVUPOsUSt_Q5yvc)

The blueprint shows three key elements to consider when putting together Field Ops Inspections as a service: service value chain; user journey stages; and service enabling components.

## Service value chain

The service value chain shows the overarching Field Operations activities. Responsibility for these activities may be shared with other FSA departments and teams.   

* **Approvals** - the registering of food business operators and approving them to carry out specified activities. Note that Approvals is out of scope for this discovery.
* **Inspections** - the inspecting of food businesses to ensure they comply with food safety regulations.
* **Sampling & testing** - the verifying of raw and processes food products as part of ensuring compliance with food safety regulations.
* **Audit** - validating that food safety compliance and inspection is being delivered.
* **Enforcement** - the applying of procedures and/or legal proceedings to improve the level of food safety compliance at food business operators.

For the purpose of this discovery, and to ensure a degree of continuity with previous work, we have re-used the service value chain created as part of the preparation work for the Field Ops Transformation programme completed by Deloitte in 2018.

## User journey stages

The user journey stages are a more granular set of activities than the service value cycle. They align with the service value cycle but enable us to group day-to-day tasks in a way that makes it easier to explain the process flow and the user experience. Responsibility for these tasks typically lies with Field Operations but inevitably relies on interaction with other FSA departments and teams, and external agencies and bodies who have a role in the overall food safety chain. 

* **Plan** - longer term planning to inspect food business operators in line with legislative and policy guidelines.
* **Schedule** - shorter term organising to arrange inspection visits and allocate appropriate inspector resource.
* **Prep** - updating or building knowledge about a food business operator to get ready for an inspection visit.
* **Visit** - conducting an inspection of a food business operator to check for food safety compliance.
* **Report** - documenting the findings of an inspection visit.
* **Follow up** - completing post-inspection procedures; applying and implementing food safety compliance improvement measures and monitoring; updating plans and schedules; undertaking further inspection and reporting work as required.
* **Service admin** - Updating or creating information and documentation; team administration. 

## Service enabling components

Service enabling components are the factors that determine how Field Operations Inspections are delivered. They start with the **jobs to be done**, the key tasks that are completed to deliver a process and the overall service. Each job is enabled by one or more of the **service enabling components** which include:
* **stakeholders** - the people who either carry out the work, support the process, or have an interest in it.
* **governance and documentation** - the legislation, policy and guidance that informs the way food safety is delivered.
* **information and technology** - the knowledge and IT that enable inspectors to carry out their work.

The service blueprint shows the dependencies between these components. These are the factors that should be considered when designing processes, tools and systems to support Field Ops Inspections. The blueprint also shows other considerations, such as required timescales and business or practical constraints. 

This means we can cross-reference factors across the lifecycle of the service and keep the bigger picture in mind. We can use the blueprint to prioritise design and development tasks and choose to improve a particular job to be done and/or an enabling component that impacts several jobs to be done.
