This wiki documents research and [recommendations](recommendations) for [Field Ops Inspection services](definition). 

Findings are based on a [discovery](methodology) project carried out by [Notbinary](team) during [Jan-Mar 2020](timeline-and-ceremonies). 

FSA Field Operations conduct inspections of Meat Plants, Dairy Plants & Wine premises (vineyards and trade). Discovery work has been undertaken across some areas of Meat and Dairy Plant inspections but there is an opportunity to look at all inspection services, as a whole, to look for patterns of user needs.

The discovery [goal](scope) is to more fully understand the:
- **Users and their needs** of the services
- Current **business processes** being operated that would be impacted by the service
- Existing **technology** that enables the delivery of the services
- Underlying **data** the services run on

This will support an end-to-end service blueprint that identifies common patterns and user needs, as well as opportunities to simplify, standardise and share tooling and to streamline areas that are disjointed to run a more effect field operation.
