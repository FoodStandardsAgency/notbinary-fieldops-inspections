### Duplications at inspection
Inspectors are printing off letters for previously found infringements. These are handed out if the problem has not been resolved during the inspection. If it has been found then this is not necessary. This could be streamlined as a digital solution or with clear guidance on when infringement notices should be given (i.e immediately or within a set time 48 hours for instance).

### Duplications during reporting
Report creating is causing a lot of switching between various tools - Word to draft, Chronos, K2 reporting and plant profiles.
UAIs must contact the FVC inorder to have them check over their letters before they are sent. This is when email "ping-pong" can occur.
