## Opportunity

The FSA Field Operations teams conduct inspections of dairy, meat and wine business premises.  

Discovery work has been undertaken across some areas of meat plant and dairy farm inspections but there is an opportunity to look at all inspection services, as a whole, to look for patterns of user needs. 

## Goals

The discovery aims to more fully understand: 

- The patterns of user needs across food inspection services
- Current business processes being operated that would be impacted by the service
- Existing technology that enables the delivery of the services
- Underlying data the services run on

This will help identify [opportunities](backlog) to: 

* **simplify**, **standardise** and **share** inspection assets, processes and tooling 
* **streamline** what is disjointed to make it work better

Insights from the discovery will help inform how new or existing services can be developed for delivering Field Ops Inspections, or improvements to existing operations may be supported through digital services.


## Scope

This discovery explores commonalities and differences across inspection delivery for: 

* [Dairy hygiene](service-context#dairy)
* [Meat hygiene](service-context#meat) ([unannounced inspections](service-context#unannounced-inspections-and-audits))
* [Wine standards](service-context#wine)

This discovery builds on previous work research. To avoid duplication, it will not be looking into or revisiting:

* Ongoing site-based meat plant inspection 
* [Timesheeting](https://github.com/notbinary/fsa-timesheeting/wiki)
* [Resourcing](https://github.com/notbinary/fsa-inspections/wiki)
* Registration and Approvals
