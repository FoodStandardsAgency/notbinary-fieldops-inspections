This is a full tooling comparison for inspections. It compares across the three areas of inspection, showing shows the comparison of tools across each of the three areas of inspections. Each row contains a comparable tool used to accomplish the same task. Similarities are shown in the bold and italicised cells. We have discovered a common pattern in the tasks and steps involved across each of the three inspection services.

## How to use

The "Stage of inspection" column is the high level inspection process. These can be found throughout the [user journeys](user-journeys-comparison) and the [service blueprint](service-blueprint) and are made up of:
1. Plan
2. Schedule
3. Prepare
4. Inspect
5. Report
- Additionally operations which sits alongside of the inspection process by a user

The "Job to be done" column holds the steps within each stage. For example,  during the **schedule** stage, the user will assign an inspection to themselves, check for any nearby FBOs and carry out some form of route planning. All of these granular steps are common across all three types of inspection.

## Duplication of effort throughout services
We have observed that there are clear duplications among processes, effort and data handling across all three services of inspections. Where these duplications are occurring we have heard pain points from users. As well as this it is creating more work than should be necessary.

The reasons these duplications of work are occurring is due to a lack of trust in the systems and tools not working correctly or being connected. We heard from the Wine team that they are almost doubling their work by storing and referencing information in a few different systems. Due to a system failure on the S drive, users have lost trust in the systems. And so, they are now saving work on the Microsoft Access Wine Database as well as the shared N drive. This is doubling the work for a small team and shifting their focus from the job of carrying out inspections.
