System will email a producer report (farm profile incl history) to user, user may print out from this system. <br />User will use in conjunction with PowerBI to see if there are any nearby farms. | List is not ring fenced to the areas that the user is responsible forUsers use area rather than clusters for dairy inspections, this is a hangover from the meat system - DB said they could easily change this. Email user receives could have more value i.e. have an ID in the subject line for finding quickly. <br />The producer report takes 24 hours to be generated and sent over by email. This could be down to a scheduled job running on the database.|
