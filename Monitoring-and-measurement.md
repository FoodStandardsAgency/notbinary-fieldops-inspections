Given that all three inspection teams are gathering, collating and storing large amounts of data and information it has been surprising how difficult it has proved to see where that information is leveraged for the purpose of monitoring and measuring Field Operations progress and performance. Monitoring is effectively being done at a very local level within each team and often tracked manually.

There is an appetite among all of the inspection teams to leverage PowerBI for reporting and an acknowledgement that the data required is currently collated in multiple formats and tools, that there is duplication and double-handling in many cases, and inconsistent quality of information captured.

Key Performance Indicators are in place for some but not all inspection teams, and the indicators that are in place vary from being focused on individual inspector performance (e.g. number of inspections to be completed in a given period) to having more of a focus on the percentage of FBOs on specified inspection frequencies to be visited.

While basic information such as the numbers of FBOs in scope can be found relatively easily, the reactive nature of inspection scheduling (where the outcome of an inspection determines follow up action and future visit frequencies) makes it very difficult to pin down the full scope and scale of inspections across all three areas and to design a way to monitor and measure all aspects of the service. At present, this is compounded by the leveraging of inspectors between teams to back-fill part-time roles and the challenge of prioritising one inspection service over another on any given day when there is changed or increased demand.

### Dairy

There is no formal monitoring and measurement approach for Dairy Hygiene Inspections. Dairy does have probably the most mature set of Key Performance Indicators that drive how many farms should be inspected for each of its inspection cycles.

Effective monitoring and measurement on the number of visits and outcomes of inspections is made more difficult by the proliferation of places where information is stored and maintained.

The Change & Business Implementation team does not currently provide or support data analysis or reporting for the Dairy Hygiene Inspection team although some initial discussions and attempts to obtain the data required for dairy hygiene service reporting have taken place. Further work is on hold, partly pending the outcome of this discovery.

Some limited data on dairy inspections can be leveraged via the charging process. Currently the dairy hygiene team produces a spreadsheet to record raw cows drinking milk sampling visits which is uploaded to an Oracle invoicing system.

The K2 Scheduler provides some data on when inspections are due based on their current inspection cycle and/or risk status. However effective monitoring is made difficult by the scheduler being set up based on meat hygiene inspection areas rather than the nine dairy areas. 

### Meat (UAI/Audit)

The Change & Business Implementation team currently provides and supports fairly comprehensive data analysis or reporting for the Meat Hygiene Inspection team. 

Most reporting is focused on data captured via the Timesheet and Charging systems; all meat hygiene inspector and official vet time is logged against activity codes with related charging rates.

The reports requested by heads of department have been formalised as Business Review Reports. This provides a view of the hours worked, activities logged (with a focus on non-chargeable hours), and normal hours or overtime.
* Financial year N-code hours
* Financial year N-code breakdown
* Comparative 12 month rolling view
* Financial year overtime hours
* Financial year overtime breakdown

CBI have also shown that a more granular level of data can be reported to allow regional and national views, reporting on other activity codes including inspection (INSP) and audit (IAUD).

For UAI, CBI produces a two page report incorporating:
* Target to Submit Met - monthly view on the number of inspection reports submitted.
* Individual UAI performance - inspector level reporting.

There is ongoing work with the Audit team and investigation into tracking service delivery partner performance.

Target to submit reports is driven by a KPI to submit reports within five days and to approve reports within a further five days.

### Wine
Nearly all data captured as part of wine standards inspections is stored in a MS Access database. This is not compatible with PowerBI which is typically used for data analysis and reporting across Field Operations making it difficult to present service level information, or compare and contrast wine inspection data with that from meat and dairy. 

The Change & Business Implementation team does not currently provide or support any data analysis or reporting for the Wine Standards Inspection team. Further work is on hold pending the outcome of this discovery.

Performance data is collated in the wine standards database. This includes an Excel spreadsheet for tracking visits which is maintained manually by inspectors. This is used to monitor progress through the year.

KPIs for inspectors were first set in July 2019. Based on current FBO numbers and inspection frequencies, each full-time inspector has a target of 172 inspections to complete per year. There is a pro rata target for part-time inspectors.
 


## Continuous improvement as a way of working

Continuous improvement is a critical part of ensuring a service remains fit for purpose and making it a long-term success. Continuous improvement means having an ongoing approach to monitoring and measuring all the elements that make up a service and refining them as situations and business needs change.

## Current situation

The discovery found that continuous improvement across all three inspection teams tends to be driven as local initiatives, typically in response to very practical, every day requirements to complete inspection activities more effectively.

There has been some sharing of ideas across inspections (for example, the K2 scheduler has been adapted for both UAI and Dairy), but also numerous examples of similar needs being addressed by separate initiatives either duplicating effort or increasing the range of processes and tools that must then be supported.

There are also examples of solutions being developed in isolation for one inspection team without a broader consideration for how that solution could be leveraged by other teams (for example, the proposed tablet for Dairy Hygiene inspectors was developed in response to a perceived need to replace the Anoto Digipen solution, but not as a potential solution for all inspection data capture).

Continuous improvement is hampered by a general lack of broader service design and specific inspection process mapping. This makes it very difficult to put challenges in daily working in perspective or to identify potential impact of fixes on up- and downstream processes.


## Future ways of working
Continuous improvement could be enabled by:
* Taking a service-design approach to defining the broad structure of Field Operations and its objectives across Dairy, Meat and Wine inspections. Look for commonalities before understanding differences.
* Process mapping the tasks involved in inspection to fully understand and visualise dependencies and create a sense of workflow rather than standalone activities.
* Use workflow to prioritise pinch points in the process and/or validate pain points experienced by inspection teams in the field and stakeholders in the wider organisation.
* Use process and workflow to highlight manual vs technology-supported tasks. 
* Target process and/or technology improvements using key users and stakeholders to drive and champion initiatives on a continual basis, working to more agile principles and tackling fixes incrementally.
