The following table summarises some of the headline commonalities and differences between the inspection domains in a series of macro contexts:

- **Why**: mission; legal and governance drivers; KPIs and OKRs  
- **Who**: operations; actors; subjects; stakeholders; touchpoints; policyholders; funders; related schemes   
- **What:** service scope; inspection, enforcement and related official control activities      
- **Where:** environmental contexts and constraints; target establishments and premises      
- **When:** trigger events; cycles and frequency
- **How:** training; guidance; documentation; knowledge sharing

There are many **common areas** that can be built on to simplify, standardise and streamline inspection services carried out by the FSA (although not all are beneficial). 

Areas of **difference** present constraints to preserve the integrity of individual services or opportunities to eliminate wasteful variation. 

| Macro Contexts | Common                                                       | Different                                                    |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Why**        | - Each service implements Official Controls to ensure public safety for food. <br />- These are described in various EU & UK legislation. | - A key driver for wine inspection is brand and revenue protection, which influences a different approach to inspection and relationship with [FBOs](glossary#fbo).<br />- DEFRA are policyholders for Wine Inspection, and the FSA has policy jurisdiction over Meat and Dairy. <br />- Operational reporting metrics and tools vary across inspection areas. |
| **Who**        | - Each food domain has at least one Lead Inspector, and a number of full-time Inspectors.<br />- Service resourcing is supported by part-time or assistant Inspectors taken from the wider [MHI](#glossary#mhi) pool (including [SDP](glossary#sdp) contractors). <br />- Third parties are used to support inspection delivery, such as for sampling. <br />- Internal stakeholders have interactions with or dependencies on third parties (such as industry bodies, local authorities and other government agencies). | - Field Veterinary Coordinators are responsible for coordination of unannounced inspections (rather than UAI Leads).<br />- Dairy Inspection has dedicated backoffice and customer support. <br />- There is no Technical Lead for Wine Inspection. |
| **What**       | - Each domain conducts routine and non-routine inspections.<br />- Each domain has a defined set of inspection tasks and requirements.<br />- Each domain distinguishes between high and low risk inspections.<br />- Off-site preparation is carried out before each inspection, and is informed by a site's inspection history.<br />- Each domain must formally report inspection visit outcomes, including recording or documenting supporting evidence. | - FBOs have different responsibilities (eg, vineyards need to submit annual Production Reports).<br />- Wine Inspection activities are not chargeable.<br />- Wine Inspection provide more advisory services, while Dairy and Meat are predominantly  compliance and enforcement focused. |
| **Where**      | The types of establishment that are subject to official controls in each domain are well defined. <br />- Each domain has or maintains a register of establishments that are subject to official controls. <br />- Each inspector is primarily responsible for a geographical 'patch'.<br />- Inspectors routinely work from home and on the move. | - Regions and areas are not aligned across meat, dairy and wine inspection services.<br />- Dairy inspections happen at one type of establishment. There is significantly more variety in environments for Wine inspections. |
| **When**       | - Visit frequency and scheduling limits are defined in regulations, and informed by the product handled or type of [FBO](glossary#fbo). <br />- The operating schedule is adjusted based on the outcome of inspections.<br />- Each domain responds to [incidents](glossary#incident) outside of the inspection cycle.<br />- Inspections for individual [FBOs](glossary#fbo) are initially triggered by new registrations or approvals, and may subsequently be adjusted based on inspection results. | - Wine inspections are typically by appointment, whereas other services are unannounced.<br />- Meat inspections are in step with the Audit cycle, which is controlled by the FSA. <br />- Schedule planning is semi-automated through K2 for Dairy and Meat, but more manual for WIne (based on Access and Excel outputs). |
| **How**        | - The [MOC](glossary#moc) is recognised as the authorative source of guidance for each inspection domain.<br />- Each domain has regular team meetings for knowledge sharing. <br />- Good practice happens both outside and inside the FSA (such as with plant profiles). | - Technical leadership is distributed across Wine Inspectors in the absence of a Technical Lead. |
