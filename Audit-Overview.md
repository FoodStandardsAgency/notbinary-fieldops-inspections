## Summary

### Digital Opportunities 

#### Streamline / standardise notes capture and recording

*   Notes capture is foundational to the audit process: 
    *   without them, there is no report or evidence to support notices and corrective action plans
*   Build these up as the auditor goes on the visit
    *   different plans have different layouts and optimal auditing/inspection routes
    *   entry sequence needs to be flexible rather than fixed to guidance form structure 
*   Reduce the time to prepare 
    *   ahead of closing meeting and for report write-up after the visit
    *   eliminate the need to collate related notes that may otherwise be spread out because of the guidance form structure
    *   Improve how they are presented in closing meeting

#### Improve retention / central storage

*   Currently all evidence / notes are stored locally by individual auditors
    *   no access to these if an auditor leaves or is unavailable
    *   not possible to verify or enforce legal retention policy
*   Email system doesn’t support large attachments
    *   audit reports have many photographs
    *   better to be able to link to an online repository for the report and supporting notes

### Notable Issues / Risks

*   Exports: Third country requests for audit reports and notes may not always be fulfilled
    *   risk to reputation
    *   risk to commercial opportunities
*   Connectivity remains an issue
    *   effectively forces analogue process resulting in duplication of followup work 
    *   any solution should support offline notes capture / sync
*   Performance of K2 Audit Scheduler and Chronos is very poor
    *   regardless of quality of connection, these key systems are slow to respond to user requests, process data and serve results
    *   there may be some quick wins to improve this through: 
        *   improving server capabilities
        *   pruning database records
        *   restructuring / indexing underlying data tables and joins


### iAuditor 

Selected features that serve Auditor user needs
*   GPS via phone used to store location of site, which is presented as a map in establishment details 
*   Media is contextually presented: 
	*   grouped/collated by discrepancy area, so it can clearly evidence non-compliances discussed during closing meeting
	*   thumbnails / ‘contact sheet’ view at the end of shows full visual story of site visit
*   Last page clearly shows
    *   Final score
    *   Audit frequency
    *   Next followup window
*   End Audit: to complete and apply date/timestamp
