## Definition 

Field Operations Inspections delivers official controls for food business operators in the meat, dairy and wine sectors. Inspections are designed to check that operators are compliant with food safety regulations (in the case of meat and dairy) and EU marketing regulations (in the case of wine) on a regular and ongoing basis.

Inspections require the coordination of activities with other agencies and third parties who have a role in the end-to-end food safety chain. The FSA has responsibility for a range of controls at different stages in the food safety chain for each commodity.

Field Ops Inspections involves having a regular announced or unannounced physical presence on dairy farms, at meat plants, and at vineyards and wine traders; observation, recording, and assessment of activity; issuing advice, warnings and enforcement for non-compliance; and auditing those processes to support consistency and quality in the way official controls are delivered and implemented.

Field Operations carries out inspections under the FSA's jurisdiction for dairy and meat and under Defra's jurisdiction for wine. They cover dairy, meat and wine business operators in England and Wales, and wine business operators in Northern Ireland.

## Mission
Field Operations inspections enable the FSA to deliver on its core remit: to ensure that the food people buy and eat is safe and what it says it is.

Inspections have been designed as a way to deliver **official controls**, the checks and measures designed to assure food safety. Inspections are focused on validating approved food business activity and identifying non-compliance with food safety regulations.

The geographical spread of food business operators; the variation in size, scale and operation of those businesses; the complex inter-dependencies between numerous agencies and bodies in the food safety chain; and the need for observational monitoring of compliance, creates a very real challenge for the delivery of official controls.

## Vision
Field Operations Inspections should:
* Be delivered in a way that enables the implementation of the official controls.
* Be delivered in the required timeframes for each food business sector.
* Be delivered in a way that encourages and drives compliance, to reduce the number of repeat visits and follow up actions.


## Goals
With a more service-focused approach, Field Operations Inspections could:
* Provide clear, documented assurance that the official controls have been implemented to a high-quality and more consistent standard.
* Deliver data and information that can be leveraged more easily for continual improvement within the FSA, and to better inform other agencies and parties involved in the overall food safety chain for dairy, meat and wine.
* Develop an inspection model that can be extended to other food commodities as and when required.
* Develop an inspection model that further enables current career enhancement opportunities, and supports greater workforce flexibility.
* Drive continual improvement in the level of 'first-time' compliance, and a reduction in the need for follow up and enforcement proceedings.
* Use technology and processes to improve the scheduling of inspections and allocation of resources to reduce the amount of manual and repeat work.
* Use technology and processes to improve the reporting of inspections to reduce the amount of manual work, double-handling, data transfer, and information duplication.


## Service Components 
Field Operations inspections are focused on dairy, meat, and wine. These inspections have been consolidated under the FSA remit, having been inherited from a number of earlier food hygiene, safety and related agencies. Some inspection work is also conducted on behalf of, or directly under the remit of, other agencies. This is particularly the case for wine which is overseen by Defra.

This discovery has involved:
* Dairy, all inspection types.
* Meat, with a focus on unannounced inspections and audit.
* Wine, all inspection types.

Inspections conducted as part of registration and approval processes were not in scope for this discovery. They have been flagged as related processes and earmarked for future discovery.
