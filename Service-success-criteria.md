## Understand service success criteria
Success criteria are the outcomes of a process or task that enable a 'job to be done', and that meets the stakeholder's expectations and objectives.

The service blueprint includes the success criteria for the activities for each 'job to be done' in delivering Field Ops inspections. These should inform any future service design, process design or improvement, and technical solution procurement or development.

At a service level, success criteria should address the higher-level strategic objectives and intended outcomes of Field Operations and while is is possible to identify these objectives, outcomes and success criteria it is much more difficult to track success across the service as a whole due to the silo structures in place and incomparable KPIs.

## Identified service success criteria


The following success criteria, that ultimately contribute towards the FSA's food safety remit, have been identified as being a potential outcome of Field Ops inspections as a service:
* **Increased levels of compliance** - Enabling FBOs to apply regulations should drive an increase in compliance.
* **Reduced number of incidents and enforcements** - Enabling FBOs to apply regulations should lead to a drop in enforcement and prohibition.
* **Better and more efficient use of people and skills** - Process mapping and workflow should enable repeatable work to be more system managed allowing inspectors to focus on using and developing their technical skills and enhancing the relationship with FBOs.
* **Improved ability to manage complex information** - Improved tooling and smarter workflows with business rules and conditions should enable the overall management and flow of information and reduce the amount of inspector time spent on data entry and information transfer. It should also enable a more case management approach to inspections within and beyond Field Operations.
* **Ability to leverage data and enable continuous improvement** - Improved tooling, smarter workflows, and data capture and storage should enable Field Operations and the stakeholder groups that either contribute to or consume the service and the information it creates to scope, plan, manage and maintain the people and technology resources required to operate the service.
