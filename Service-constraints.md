## Understand service constraints

Service constraints are factors that should be taken into consideration when designing, operating and improving workplace planning for meat plant inspections.

Constraints are not necessarily roadblocks or reasons not to do things; they provide a way to recognise concerns, potential clashes of interest, technical and process-related issues, and other factors that could prevent the service from being fully successful.

They enable a service team to either find ways to remove or reduce the constraint, or build an acceptance that there will be limitations to what the service can achieve.

Constraints could be:
* **Known knowns** - Things we know will have an impact and can clearly define.
* **Known unknowns** - Things we know will have an impact but can't clearly define at the moment.

## Identified service constraints

The service blueprint picks out the constraints at a 'jobs to be done' level. The following section outlines the broader constraints on managing inspections as a service.


**Ops Transformation Programme**
| Service Analysis                                             |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| The work of the Ops Transformation Programme is a known known. It plays an important part in determining the future state of inspections. It is important that this broad and deep review aligns with ongoing initiatives at a more local, team level in Field Operations to avoid duplication of effort or risk of missed opportunities to leverage good practice and solutions. |


**Local initiatives**
| Service Analysis                                             |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Each team has a number of local initiatives in progress. These are both a known known and a known unknown. Some of these are specifically targeted at improving team dynamics and ways of working, or tackling specific pain points. At the same time there are a number of IT-related projects tackling similar issues but working in apparent isolation from each other. It is not clear how initiatives are triggered and subsequently progressed and tracked, or how to leverage learnings across all of the inspection teams which would be a key benefit for operating inspections as a service. This risks duplication of time and effort, and could enable rather than discourage silo ways of working.|


**FSA IT/Digital initiatives**
| Service Analysis                                             |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Some of the local initiatives mentioned above have either been triggered by or have engaged with IT and FSA Digital. These technology projects are a known unknown because it is not clear that the output is designed to be leveraged across other inspection teams or simply to manage specific pain points. On a positive note, they are aligned with some of the ideas to be tested that were captured in the Ops Transformation programme interim model. |


**Initiatives out of sync**
| Service Analysis                                             |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| The Ops Transformation programme interim model presented in 2018/19 outlines a sequence of actions to map processes and procedures before moving to a phase of testing out ideas. Some of these ideas seem to have been put into play by other teams, but before the broader mapping and research has been completed (or even started). This is a known known. It creates a risk of duplicating effort and reinforcing the current silo ways of working. |


**Importance of the Manual for Official Controls**
| Service Analysis                                             |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| The Manual for Official Controls (MOC) plays a central role in Field Ops inspections. Work has been undertaken to make the MOC available digitally and to move away from its original print format.<br><br> It is to the credit of the teams that the MOC is consistently seen as the central source of truth for delivering inspections within the scope of the required regulations. However it has also been regarded by those new to the inspection teams as not fit for purpose and difficult to use at the moment of need. <br><br>Management and maintenance of the MOC is a major constraint. The content management and administration time required to keep it up to date, or at least to review it goes largely untracked.<br><br>The distributed nature of content management creates challenges. While content being maintained by technical leads means the content is written from authority, it means that each section and subsection of the MOC diverges from a common style over time. Ad hoc updates to specific parts of the MOC also mean that content can become contradictory or ambiguous.<br><br> Being sure whether an action is legally-binding and compulsory or is guidance for good practice is obscured by the mix of very formal and relatively informal content without a consistent way of presenting the difference.<br><br>  Finding a solution for the MOC moving forward is a known known. |


**General lack of process mapping or workflow**
| Service Analysis                                             |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Although some sections of the MOC contain flow diagrams, there does not appear to be a consistent approach to whether a flow diagram is required and to what level. <br><br>From an inspections as a service perspective, there is an absence of a process library which makes it more difficult to match user pain points with specific points in a broader workflow and to pin point root causes and/or downstream impacts. This kind of analysis ends up relying on feedback and comments and may encourage local initiatives to resolve perceived pains. <br><br>Lack of a process library also impedes the ability to map and test changes to the workflow or to adapt workflow to accommodate variations between teams. |


**Consistency and quality of legally-required ways of working**
| Service Analysis                                             |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| The level of inconsistency in how common tasks are done is a known known. A particular area of concern is the approach to evidence gathering where, despite clear guidance being available from FSA Legal, has proved challenging where insufficient, or incorrectly or poorly captured evidence has meant legal teams cannot pursue a prosecution or even adopt a case from the outset.<br><br>Evidence gathering currently relies on the use of both manual and digital tools, including contemporaneous notebooks and camera phones. |


**Untracked time and goodwill**
| Service Analysis                                             |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Time and effort to operate inspections as a service is something of a known unknown. There is no consistent or wholesale time tracking - timesheets are only used in dairy and meat where there is chargeable time for inspections.>br<br>There is a lot of goodwill across all teams to do what it takes to deliver inspections and associated work. This also covers team support and development activities. There is no real tracking of time to update documentation for example.<br><br>This makes it very difficult to extract a true cost for running inspections as a service. |


**Aligning the service with a 'Dairy Farm to Bottle', 'Farm to Plate', 'Vineyard to Glass' timeline**
| Service Analysis                                             |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Field Ops inspections in all three domains are part of much longer food safety chains from the original source (a dairy farm, a livestock farm or a vineyard) to the point where someone consumes the product. There is a complex set of complementary and competing checks along the way conducted by the FSA in places as well as a host of other agencies, trade bodies, and assurance schemes.<br><br> There is an interplay between these checks and often a need to coordinate visits and/or share information to inform one another. <br><br>There is no clear view at a service level of the timeline from a food type perspective. Teams know who else is involved and who they need to engage with but it is very difficult to quickly pick out where the FSA fits in the bigger workflow and which agency takes priority at any given time. This is probably a known known.  |


**Service Delivery Partner involvement - April 2020 onwards**
| Service Analysis                                             |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| The new Service Delivery Partner (SDP) contract implementation from April 2020 is a known known. This continues the involvement of Eville & Jones as the sole provider of contract meat hygiene inspector and official veterinarian resource.<br><br> It also extends that to providing dairy hygiene inspectors with an agreed 10% of dairy inspections being allocated to them to develop and maintain skills.<br><br> This adds to the complex variables that inform the planning and scheduling of meat and dairy inspections. While creating flexibility it, true demand for inspectors that is coming from teams working in silos obscures the overall resource requirement to fulfil inspection need. <br><br> It also requires coordination of data capture, report creation, and information sharing where inspections are conducted by either FSA inspectors, or contract inspectors, or a mix of both.<br><br>The SDP plays a critical role in delivering meat inspections and it is likely this will increasingly become the case in enabling dairy inspections in future. The leaning on contract inspectors to fill gaps blurs the ability to fully scope the size of workforce required and the true cost of operating inspections. |

**Potential to view inspections with a case management lens is obscured**
| Service Analysis                                             |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| The silo nature of inspection delivery and the localised approach to supporting and enabling the work is obscuring the fact that many dispersed teams in Field Ops, Ops Assurance, CSU, and others are contributing to the case history of each FBO.<br><br> This information could be leveraged to facilitate inspections as a service as well as enabling better business and technical support, but it is captured in different tools and formats and scattered across multiple repositories.<br><br> Tracking who has done what, when and why, and consolidating all of the output from inspections, is difficult and can result in overlaps in scheduling (particularly with UAI and Audit); duplication of data; disparity between information; and an inconsistent experience for the FBO.  |


**Legislation, policy & business rules**|  

| Service Analysis                                             |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Legislation cannot be changed in the short-term and is not a viable way of driving continuous improvement. |
| Policy and business rule revisions at the FSA level (or Defra for Wine Standards) could, and are, undertaken where required. These must be interpreted and communicated to Field Operations and those involved in inspections in a way that avoids ambiguity and misunderstanding. |
| Changes to policy, process and procedures can be achieved in a shorter timeframe than updating legislation. It is still not a simple undertaking as multiple industry bodies and/or stakeholders must be involved. |
| It is also worth noting that during this discovery, the UK left the European Union and entered an agreed 12 month withdrawal transition period. While EU legislation is expected to be transposed to the UK statute book, there is a known unknown as to how food safety regulations may change. This has been further compounded by the subsequent global Coronavirus outbreak and shift in domestic and international attention. |
