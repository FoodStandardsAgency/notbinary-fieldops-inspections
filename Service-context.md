## Operational context

The three inspection areas have come together under the FSA, inherited from earlier food hygiene and food safety agencies and organisations.

## Dairy
Dairy hygiene inspections are conducted to support EU and UK food safety regulations. The FSA's remit essentially covers milk 'from teat to bulk tank'. There is a specific objective to inspect, sample and test raw cows drinking milk (RCDM) where it is being sold to the public. Regular drinking milk is overseen by Red Tractor Assurance and local authorities beyond the bulk tank stage of the dairy food chain.

Dairy hygiene policy is owned and defined by the FSA.

Dairy hygiene inspections are conducted unannounced at approximately **8,500 dairy farms** across England and Wales. Northern Irish dairy farms do not fall under the Field Operations' remit.

Dairy farms are inspected on a complex frequency cycle of 10 year, two year or six month inspections, dependent on the primary product, the leading inspection body, the outcome of previous inspections and the status of any current enforcements.

FSA dairy inspections are organised around **nine areas** across England and Wales and inspections are delivered by:

* 9 x Full-time Dairy Hygiene Inspectors (DHIs) allocated to time critical and/or high risk cases.
* 25 x Part-time Dairy Hygiene Inspectors (MHIs) backfilled using Meat Hygiene Inspectors as required.


## Meat

Meat hygiene inspections are conducted to support EU and UK food safety regulations.
Meat hygiene policy is owned and defined by the FSA.

Meat Plant Inspections are carried out at approximately **900 Food Business Operator** (FBO) establishments across England & Wales by approximately **450 permanent** and **350 contract inspectors and veterinarians**.

The FBOs are distributed across **12 operational areas** in England and Wales, each with an area manager, and **33 clusters**, each with an Inspection Team Leader (ITL). A cluster may cover any number of FBOs depending on size and scale of the plants and complexity of their operations.

**Note.** In Northern Ireland, officials from the Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs (DAERA) carry out meat hygiene official controls in approved establishments on behalf of the FSA.

### Unannounced inspections and audits

In addition to the ongoing meat hygiene and veterinary inspections at meat plants, unannounced inspections (UAI) are conducted in standalone cutting plants; co-located cutting plants; and ready-to-eat plants.

UAI part of Field Operations and is organised across **three regions** (North, East, and Wales & West). There are approximately: **800 standalone cutting plants**; and **400 co-located cutting plants**.

Unannounced inspections are delivered by:
* 9 x Field Veterinary Leads
* 18 x Field Veterinary Coordinators
* 3 x Full-time UAI Leads
* 24 x Part-time UAI inspectors (Meat Hygiene Inspectors released by Inspection Team Leads from routine meat hygiene roles).

The schedule of unannounced inspections is closely intertwined with meat plant audits. Meat plant audits are conducted by the Audit team which is part of Operations Assurance. The outcome from an audit drives the frequency and nature of UAI visits although the two sets of reports are separate and distinct.

Audits are delivered by:
* 1 x Audit Lead
* 3 x Full-time Auditors (one per area)

**Note.** The scope of this discovery includes UAI and Audit; it excludes ongoing meat hygiene inspection.

## Wine  

Wine Standards inspections are conducted to support EU marketing regulations on the importing, labelling and making of wine in the UK. Inspections cover **six areas** across England, Wales and Northern Ireland. There is some interaction with the equivalent inspection service in Scotland.

Wine Standards policy is owned and defined by Defra.

Wine sector FBOs are categorised as either:
* Vineyard
* Trader

There are approximately **700 FBOs categorised as vineyards** (including 169 wine-producing wineries) and **1,330 categorised as traders**.

Establishments covered include vineyards and wineries; bottling plants; importers; and bonding warehouses. All premises are inspected on an annual basis as a service minimum, with additional visits determined by the outcome of previous inspections or external requests.

Compared to dairy and meat, Wine Standards has adopted a more advisory approach to the industry and often acts as a 'go-to' source of guidance. It's inspections still focus on compliance with regulations however.

Wine inspections are delivered by:
* 1 x Wine Standards Inspection Lead
* 5 x Full-time Wine Standards Inspectors
* 1 x Part-time Wine Standards Inspector
* 5 x assistants supporting low-risk inspections on a part-time or career enhancement basis.


## Governance overview

Field Operations inspections enable the FSA to deliver on its core remit: to ensure that the food people buy and eat is safe and what it says it is.
 
The FSA strategic plan for 2015-2020 set out proposed approaches to ensure that consumers are consistently protected, informed and empowered:

* Using science, evidence and information both to tackle the challenges of today, and to identify and contribute to addressing emerging risks for the future
* Using legislative and non-legislative tools highly effectively to protect consumer interests and deliver consumer benefits – influencing business behaviour in the interests of consumers being genuinely open and engaging, finding ways to empower consumers both in our policy making and delivery, and in their relationship with the food industry.

Field Operations largely puts these approaches into practice in the way it delivers inspections. It is engaged in sampling and testing using approved laboratories to provide scientific evidence to assess incidents and non-compliance; and it deploys skilled and experienced inspectors to collate, report and assess the information needed to provide food safety assurance.

### EU and UK regulations

All Field Operations inspections are governed by EU and/or UK legislation and policy defined by the FSA (dairy and meat) or Defra (wine). Volume Two of the Manual for Official Controls provides an extensive list of the European and UK regulations that inform the need for food safety inspections.

Some of the key legislation that governs Field Operations inspections across Dairy, Meat and Wine include:

* Food Safety Act 1990
* The Welfare of Animals at the Time of Killing (England) Regulations 2015 (SI No. 1782)
* The Welfare of Animals at the Time of Killing (Wales) Regulations 2014 (SI No. 951 (W. 92))
* The Official Controls (Animals, Feed and Food) (England) Regulations 2006 (SI No. 3472)
* The Official Controls (Animals, Feed and Food) (Wales) Regulations 2007 (SI No. 196 (W. 15))
* The Food Safety and Hygiene (England) Regulations 2013 (SI No. 2996)
* The Food Hygiene (Wales) Regulations 2006 (SI No. 31 (W. 5))
* UK Statutory Instrument: The Wine Regulations 2011 SI No 2936 (as amended by SI 2013 No 3235)

This list is not exhaustive but indicates the complex nature of delivering the right type of inspection at the right time and in the right place.

### FSA policy

The Manual for Official Controls (MOC) Volume One has evolved as the 'single source of truth' for all inspection services. Although predominantly covering meat hygiene, the manual includes dedicated chapters for dairy and wine. It provide legislative and policy references where applicable, as well as process and procedural content to act as a central reference guide for all inspectors and stakeholders.

The MOC is maintained by technical leads in the relevant fields, as well as technical leads in areas such as legal policy.

### Operational governance

In practice, inspections are governed by a combination of the regulations and policy at each of the service value chain and user journey stages we have used to organise this discovery. The need to implement and manage official controls means that governance informs each of the Plan, Schedule, Prep, Inspect, Report and Follow Up stages. The outcome of an inspection or audit typically requires a defined response; this in turn drives the subsequent visit frequency and the activities undertaken by the inspection teams. 

Changes in regulation have an impact on the inspections Field Operations need to conduct; changes in how Field Operations conducts those inspections is more easily managed since it is controlled by the FSA (for dairy and meat). It is somewhat more complicated for wine because policy is owned by Defra.
