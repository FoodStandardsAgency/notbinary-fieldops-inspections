## 10-14 Feb 2020

[![Sprint 3 Retrospective board](uploads/retro/retro-3.png)](uploads/retro/retro-3.png)

## Actions

- Workstream Owners: *Where possible* documenting as we go - e.g. the journey wall. Could be useful to have a persona nearly ready for the synthesis session and then added to.
- Workstream Owners: remind interested parties about the show & tells.
- DM: future disco planning to accommodate a research velocity conversation - will vary project to project & user audience to user audience.
- [ ] Find a front page image for the Show & Tell that incorporates meat, milk and wine!  😀

## To improve

- Conscious of T&D workstream being isolated, and the need to understand the opportunities and challenges in this space. Some steps in mind to help ramp up, but more perhaps needed.
- Lowri - Being dogmatic about checking audio / recording settings in any new config, however confident. Could have been worse (still have users voice) but quality of what will be handed over suffered.
- Keeping the objectives of project in mind - Fine details and Red herrings e.g. digipens - used now but being mindful that won't be for much longer.
- Lowri - Can we get more participation in show & tell from the audience? e.g. askign for a round of intro's / what they're hoping to learn at the start?
- Friction and stress in the team

## Went well

- Stephen: Dedicating time to a specific area (dairy this week) to research. Makes it easier to ring fence the conversation and shut out things that are not directly relevant.
- Managing scope bound with Audit while surfacing useful insights to feed into Field Ops Inspection discovery
- Lowri: Identifying a lot of the service tendrils or other actors from relatively small number of interviews
- Stephen: Journey mapping/synthesis was a useful exercise. Lots of things to join up with this one.
- Good to catch up for one to one conversations
- Laptop collection and set-up straight forward.
- Stephen: Wifi hotspot has been much better, and GovWifi has still been pants.

## Kudos

- Stephen: To Lowri for keeping the user interviews focused and consistent.
- Ramom Alvarez-Rivera: very open, proactive and accommodating to support our learning
- Lowri: To Jonno & Stephen for taking great session notes and sharing them - helps me focus on the question asking so thank you
- Lowri to Shaun for continuing chase up of the UAI recruitment so we could focus
- Everyone for being willing to pitch in and work on team dynamic
- Carbs: good chats to bounce off and clear headspace
- IT/digital team keen to share what they know and the systems.
