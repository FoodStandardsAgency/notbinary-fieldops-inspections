## Summary

The discovery finds that: 

1. Inspections is a [service capable](#service-capable) endeavour, but the FSA is not geared for delivering 'Inspections-as-a-Service'
2. Legacy [silos embed structures](pervasive-silos) and behaviours that impede a service approach
3. Domain services have [evolved organically](organic-evolution), allowing local innovation to flourish but leaving systems disjointed and vulnerable.

The individual service domains have flexibility and autonomy to own and fulfil their official controls obligations. This comes at the expense of a shared inspections service vision and supporting infrastructure (across people, processes and technology).



## Service capable

The FSA can be described as delivering meat, dairy or wine inspection services, but not as operating 'Inspections-as-a-Service', with a consistent and scalable approach across its portfolio. 

* Examining the [macro context](macro-comparison) of each service within scope shows that there are commonalities across the principles, drivers, operations and practices for implementing official controls in each food domain. 

* There is also a common inspection lifecycle that applies in each area, with defined triggers and outcomes. In each area, the same jobs need to be done in order to fulfil inspection duties. 

However, different tools, team structures and targets are in place for each inspection domain, which thwarts a coherent FSA-wide inspection service operation.  There is currently no consistent or appropriate operational or technological infrastructure in place that can be either lifted and shifted or scaled to turn-key provision a common inspections approach in other areas that the FSA has responsibility for.

This is compounded by both unclear ownership and positioning that cascades to inspection domains and an absence of a clear strategy for defining and managing the ongoing relationship with FBO customers, which can guide coherent service development.  



## Pervasive silos

The FSA has absorbed wine and dairy inspection responsibilities on top of  the original meat hygiene standards remit. Each area is largely autonomous. 

These silos can be felt at each level of services, despite the underlying commonalities - from governance, through operation, and right down to the processes and tools that are developed, used and maintained by or for each area. 

With many different ways of delivering the same activities (albeit in different contexts), it is hard to develop a coherent approach or shared vision that can be practically applied to help the teams realise the common FSA mission. 

A notable exception to domain autonomy is the reliance on meat inspectors to supplement resourcing in dairy, wine and for unannounced meat visits. While it affords some operational flexibility and staff development opportunities, often it leaves services at the mercy of pressures in ongoing meat inspection spaces. 

The current structure seems to work against efficient service delivery, and the legacy staffing strategy - including around resource sharing, role enhancement and reliance on delivery partner - constrains the delivery model. 



## Organic evolution

While each area has operational autonomy, each domain is effectively competing with the others for resources and development support. Having entrenched silos (albeit under the same Field Ops umbrella) and in the absence of a coherent service or technology design strategy, each area has evolved organically to deliver its official controls responsibilities.  

As a result, each area has developed its own workarounds to get the job done.  These 'needs-must' innovations quickly become embedded into practice, and while they might solve a local issue, they often exacerbate other parts of the process:

* processing effort and data are duplicated
* extra handoffs (and therefore points of failure) are systematised 
* automation possibilities are not realised

Tools and templates are developed that are limited by the digital capability and literacy of the individuals producing them. This both constrains and cements the idea of what is possible. 

At the same time, experiences with how technology has previously been "done to" users colours how potential solutions are perceived or received, which can undermine future digital transformation effort. 

The proliferation of localised and informal tools and workarounds leaves services disjointed and delicately balanced. This creates an inherent systemic vulnerability. It becomes hard to [stop or break practice](backlog) - even when something is actually causing more pain for users - because doing so has too great a risk of causing a service failure.
